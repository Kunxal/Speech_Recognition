Speech recognition technology enables computers to understand and process spoken language. It converts spoken words into text by analyzing audio input through algorithms and models trained on vast datasets. This technology powers voice-activated assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools. It involves complex processes such as acoustic modeling, language modeling, and decoding. Speech recognition systems are increasingly accurate and versatile, enhancing user interactions across various applications and devices.
